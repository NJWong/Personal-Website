# Who am I?
My name is Nicholas Wong. I live in Melbourne, Australia.

# What do I do?
I currently study software engineering at Monash University. I've had experience writing software ranging from embedded micro-controllers, to web and mobile applications.

I go out of my way to write clean, efficient and maintainable code.

# What am I passionate about?
I am passionate about doing awesome things and meeting new people. Technology consulting provides this on a professional level. I achieve this on a personal level by riding my motorcycle with friends and going to rider meetups.

# Why do I blog?
No particular reason - mostly because I want to :). I created this blog just before I started my final year of my software engineering degree so it's a good way to keep track of what I do, what I learn, and to keep track of how I grow.

# What will I post about?
Pretty much anything that interests me. It will be a mix of general "TIL" (Today I Learned) related posts, as well as any personal/interesting projects I'm working on. Plus anything I find useful (like a cool tool or library I stumble across).
