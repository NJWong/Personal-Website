# Who am I?
My name is Nicholas Wong. I live in Melbourne, Australia and I study software engineering at Monash University. During my time at university I've come into contact with a number of languages and tools, some as part of my coursework but most through small personal projects.

My first exposure to the world of programming was through the "COMP1100" course taught at ANU in 2010. The lecturer, Dr. Uwe Zimmer, taught us the basics of programming and algorithms using Haskell (an interesting departure from the "learn an imperative language first" style of teaching). After that I was hooked, I knew this was the kind of thing I wanted to do - I changed unversity, changed my major and here I am now still learning as much as I can with the same passion I had back all those years ago.

# Why do I blog?
No particular reason - mostly because I want to :). I created this blog just before I started my final year of my software engineering degree so it's a good way to keep track of what I do and what I learn. As past of my final year, I need to complete a year-long team software project, which aims to put everything we have learned (and more) to the test. I can feel a whole bunch of learning coming up and I want to share my experiences with those willing to read.

# What will I post about?
You'll notice that this is a "Blogfolio" - half blog, half portfolio. So it will be a mix of general "TIL" (Today I Learned) related posts, as well as any personal/interesting projects I'm working on.
